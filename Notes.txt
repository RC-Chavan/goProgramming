Go lang is compiled language, no need the JVM like vm for running the code. if you have go installed go internally handled everything.
Go tools can run file directly, without VM.
Executables are exported at compiled times, go gives you options for multiples OS i.e. windows, linux, mac.

System Apps to web Apps - cloud
Already in production  - google, kubernetes, docker, etc.

Misses out many features of other languages
1. Operator overloading
2. Method overloading / Overriding
3. try/catch is also missing - you never need that.
4. No inheritance - no classes
5. lexer is doing lot of work.


Lexer:- Lexer is a process where to programming language checks for the grammer of any language if the semicolon OR the variable names or the rules are followed properly or nor 
this is done before pre-compiling.
If you mentioned the semi colon in the go, go intelsence removes it.
